  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir

  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  def default_url(*args)
    # For Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
    # ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))
  
    "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "l_e_others_501.png"].compact.join('_')

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process scale: [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]
  # end

  # Add an allowlist of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_allowlist
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  # end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
  # end
  # file = File.extname("public/images/#{row['user_image']}") if original_filename.present?
  
  # aws環境時実装出来ていない為、保留>>
  # process convert: 'png'

  # def filename
  #   if original_filename.present?
  #     if File.extname(original_filename) == ".HEIC"
  #       super.chomp(File.extname(super)) + '.png'
